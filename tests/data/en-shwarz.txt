To the Members of the California State Assembly:

I am returning Assembly Bill 1176 without my signature.

For some time now I have lamented the fact that major issues are overlooked while many 
unnecessary bills come to me for consideration. Water reform, prison reform, and health 
care are major issues my Administration has brought to the table, but the Legislature just 
kicks the can down the alley.
Yet another legislative year has come and gone without the major reforms Californians 
overwhelmingly deserve. In light of this, and after careful consideration, I believe it is 
unnecessary to sign this measure at this time.

Sincerely,

Arnold Schwarzenegger
